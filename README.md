INSTALATION:


for this part, it is a little difficult to explain as this is just my portfolio and not something 
like and app or a particular program.
any way i will like to make it know that, bootstrap css was used here in this my project, so make sure you do not delete the link to it and also, 
no java script or any form of script was used here either.


USAGE :


this is nothing big, its just to open my portfolio, read about me and get some ideas about me, 
the things i can do, the things i will love to do and all that.


CONTRIBUTIONS:

I am open for contributions and also, ypo can contact me personally if it comes to that
contribute here on github to make my project better and easy to use, being it to make the code clean or to do what ever.
